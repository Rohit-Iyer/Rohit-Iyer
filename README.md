Hi there👋, 
I'm Rohit, a results-oriented mechanical engineer specializing in design (CAD), finite element analysis (FEA), and computer-aided engineering (CAE). 

🎓 I have a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Arizona State University and a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University, and I bring strong expertise in engineering principles and practical applications through my first princles thinking.

🦾 Proficient in ANSYS, NX PLM, Solidworks, and MATLAB, I have applied these tools to FEA, CAE, and design optimization. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Arizona State University, I mentored and graded assignments for a computer-aided engineering course. During my internship at Honeywell UOP, I optimized expansion bellows design, adhering to industry standards.

👷 I am eager to contribute my technical skills, analytical mindset, and collaborative spirit to challenging mechanical engineering projects. Let's connect to explore potential opportunities and discuss design optimization and engineering solutions

👩‍💻 I'm looking for full time opportunities as a Mechanical Engineer.

🧠 I'm interested in Mechanical Design, modelling and prototyping.

🔭 I’m currently working in Manrex as a Mechanical Design Engineer helping them in a new product design of a motorized medication cart capable of loads upto 250lbs by providing a design which retrofits into their exisiting models. 

⚡ Fun fact about me, I was part of BAJA SAE where i designed, manufactured and raced an ATV, all within one year. 

💬 Feel free to reach out to me about any questions or queries you may have about my work.
